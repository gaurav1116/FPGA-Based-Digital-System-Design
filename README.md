# FPGA-Based-Digital-System-Design

*MIMAS V2* is a feature packed yet low cost FPGA Development board featuring
Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. It is specially designed for experimenting and learning
system design with FPGAs. 
This development board features SPARTAN XC6SLX9
CSG324 FPGA with onboard 512Mb DDR SDRAM. The USB 2.0 interface
provides fast and easy configuration download to the on-board SPI flash. 
No need to buy an expensive programmer or special downloader cable to
download the bit stream to the board.

Applications

Product Prototype Development
Signal Processing
Learning Digital Electronics
Educational tool for schools and universities
